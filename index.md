tristanUtils consists of two utilities that make running & analyzing *tristan-MP* simulations easier. 

First is [automater.py](automater.md), a python script that makes running many SLURM jobs much simpler.

The second is [TristanSim](tristanSim.md), a python 3 object that contains all of the 
data in your HDF5 outputs as attributes which are lazily evaluated.
